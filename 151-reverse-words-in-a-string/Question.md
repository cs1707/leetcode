<div class="spoilers" style="display: none;">**Clarification:**

*   What constitutes a word?  
    A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
*   Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?  
    Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
*   How about multiple spaces between two words?  
    Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
