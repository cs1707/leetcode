[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/)

Given a `Weather` table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

<pre>+---------+------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | Date(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------+------------------+
|       1 | 2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 | 2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 | 2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 | 2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------+------------------+
</pre>

For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:

<pre>+----+
